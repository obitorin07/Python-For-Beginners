ðŸ§  Problem 3: Delivery Filter â€“ Only Deliver to Nearby Areas
Youâ€™re running a food delivery service.
These are the areas where you got orders:

Using list comprehension, create a new list valid_orders that only keeps orders from allowed zones.
Count how many orders were valid.

Print the updated list and count.

(Optional twist): Remove duplicates from the valid_orders list (just for cleanup).
